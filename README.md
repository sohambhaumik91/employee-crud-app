# employee-crud-app
Vanilla JS app (WIP that acts as a CRUD master for an Employee Database)
Steps to run:

1. git clone https://github.com/sohambhaumik91/employee-crud-app.git
2. cd into directory and at the root level run http-server -p 8080
3. Currently employs a Facade design pattern to attain scalability such that it provides an interface to multiple services in the future. Employee class behaves as singleton
4. Efficiently searches, filters, sorts and paginates the enployee table client side.
5. no css libraries
